## Installation

1. Install the package

```bash
# using npm
npm install expo-transparent-video

# or using yarn
yarn add expo-transparent-video
```

2. Build the package

With `expo`:

`expo-transparent-video` relies on native code, so you will need to create a development build to use it.

```bash
npx expo prebuild
npx expo run:android
```

With `react-native`:

```bash
npx react-native run-android
```

## Usage

Since this package only supports Android, it's recommended to create a platform-specific component.

VideoPlayer.android.tsx:
```tsx
import { TransparentVideoView, useVideoPlayer } from 'expo-transparent-video';

export const VideoPlayer = () => {
  const player = useVideoPlayer('https://cdn.example.com/video.webm');

  player.loop = true;
  player.play();

  return (
    <TransparentVideoView player={player} />
  );
};
```

> [!WARNING]
> `expo-transparent-video` only support external links to video files. You can't use local files.

## How to create a transparent video for Android?

The source must be a video compatible with [Android](https://developer.android.com/media/platform/supported-formats#video-codecs).

The source must be a composition of two videos vertically superposed:

1. The upper part of the video must display the rgb channels

2. The lower part of the video must display the alpha mask in grayscale
  (black -> alpha = 0% opacity, white -> alpha = 100% opacity) to apply to the rgb part.

```

> [!WARNING]
> This cannot display a video that has an alpha channel like transparent webm. It only blends rgb data with alpha data.

## But... why?

Well, the default's Android ExoPlayer [does not support alpha channel videos](https://github.com/google/ExoPlayer/issues/7789). Meaning, if your `.webm` (or other supported format) has transparency, it will be rendered as black.

This package relies on a technique explained in [this Medium article](https://medium.com/go-electra/unlock-transparency-in-videos-on-android-5dc43776cc72) to enable transparency in videos on Android.
